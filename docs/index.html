<h1>IONIA / MONTCALM COURT RECORD INTAKE</h1>

<p>
This page is for individuals who believe they experienced
<strong>procedural misconduct, record irregularities, or unfair treatment</strong>
in Ionia County or Montcalm County Circuit Court.
</p>

<div class="box">
<strong>You do NOT need to be a lawyer.</strong><br>
You do NOT need to write your life story.<br>
We are collecting <strong>specific documents</strong> to identify repeat patterns.
</div>

<h2>IMPORTANT RULES</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Upload copies — never originals</li>
  <li>PDFs preferred (photos/screenshots OK)</li>
  <li>Do not alter documents</li>
  <li>Only upload items that match the categories below</li>
</ul>

<h2>REQUIRED FILE NAMING (CRITICAL)</h2>

<div class="box">
<strong>Files are NOT automatically sorted.</strong><br>
All uploads go into a single secure folder.<br>
<strong>Your file name is how we identify and organize your documents.</strong>
</div>

<p><strong>You MUST rename your files before uploading.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Use this exact format:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>CATEGORY_LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_DATE_DESCRIPTION</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li><code>A_Exhibits_None_Smith_John_2023-04-01_TranscriptPage.pdf</code></li>
  <li><code>B_Not_Read_Doe_Jane_2022-10-07_JudgeStatement.png</code></li>
  <li><code>E_FOC_Shutdown_Johnson_Mark_2024-01-15_MatterClosedEmail.pdf</code></li>

<div class="box">
<strong>WARNING:</strong><br>
Files that are not clearly named may not be usable or attributable.
</div>

<h2>WHAT TO UPLOAD (SIMPLE LIST)</h2>

<h3>A. Exhibits Submitted But “Not in Record”</h3>
<p><strong>Upload if:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>You submitted exhibits to the court</li>
  <li>The transcript, register, or record later says “EXHIBITS: NONE”</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Exhibit list, transcript page, clerk record</p>

<h3>B. Judge Did Not Read or Review Evidence</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The judge stated they did not review exhibits</li>
  <li>The judge ruled without reviewing evidence</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Transcript, order language, sworn statement</p>

<h3>C. Child Support / Income Imputation Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Your income was imputed unfairly</li>
  <li>Real income evidence was ignored</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Support order, pay stubs, job emails</p>

<h3>D. Late Notice or Bench Warrant Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>You received notice after a hearing occurred</li>
  <li>A bench warrant issued without proper notice</li>
</ul>

<h3>E. Friend of the Court Refusal or “Shutdown”</h3>
<p><strong>This means:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>FOC refused to enforce a valid order</li>
  <li>FOC closed or dismissed your issue without a hearing</li>
  <li>You were told the matter was “resolved,” “closed,” or “not enforceable” without judicial review</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Examples:</em> Emails, letters, portal messages stating enforcement was denied or closed</p>
